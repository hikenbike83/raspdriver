A Raspberry Pi based Automatic Wardriving Solution

This collection of short BASH scripts allows a stock Raspberry Pi to become an automotive accessory that captures packets as you drive around.  The overall goal is to make it autonomous, requiring no user intervention whatsoever.  The final goal will be to port the entire project over to Python.


The project was originally built with parts laying around, so I'll do my best to find them for sale online and put in here.
